## Project Overview
This project analyzes an Instagram dataset to explore how different factors (such as captions, hashtags, impressions, and actions) affect the reach and engagement of posts.  

The analysis was done using **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.) inside a **Jupyter Notebook**.  

---

## Dataset
- The dataset contains Instagram posts with details such as:
  - `Impressions` (how many people saw the post)
  - `Total_Actions` (likes, comments, shares, saves)
  - `Engagement_Percent` (calculated as actions relative to impressions)
  - `Caption_Char` (caption length in characters)
  - `Num_Hashtags` (number of hashtags used)

---

## Key Questions Answered
Some of the analysis questions included:
1. Which posts achieved the highest engagement rate?
2. Do more hashtags always improve performance?
3. Does caption length impact reach?
4. Which posts performed best overall?

---

## Summary of Findings
- Posts with **targeted hashtags** tend to perform better than just adding more hashtags.
- Engagement rate is highest when **captions are meaningful but not too long**.
- Some posts with fewer impressions still achieved **high engagement percentages**.
- Hashtags show a **non-linear relationship**: too few or too many can reduce engagement.

---

## Recommendations
- Focus on **quality over quantity** when it comes to hashtags.  
- Keep captions **clear and engaging**, avoid being too short or too lengthy.  
- Reuse post styles that previously achieved **high engagement**.  
- Test and monitor performance continuously to refine strategy.
